## Constructs


### Mood modulation/reflection

- **Note 3** (15.06, note #4 that day): And note on activity from early today just in case I didn't already make a note of it we did have a students of, and interact with the robot was going to crouching in front of it and then when I was doing so for laxing sounds and music and lie down next to the robot


- **Note 20** (15.06, note #21 that day): teacher brought class to see the robot. teacher said that the class were due to do exercise outdoors, teacher changed plan do a walk and see the robot, the class had calmed far quicker than other methods. Said it was good to have something else for them to focus on. teacher also asked if the robot could hold a ball and/ or be programmed to play boccia.


- **Note 26** (16.06, note #6 that day): Get add pictures with a member of staff so survey stating to staff and to robot that was getting angry then went to select calming sounds and music not sure what made us before did at the end


- **Note 27** (16.06, note #7 that day): Interaction just before this last one was a student that hadn't interacted with the robot before, staff said that this student doesn't leave the classroom very often so it was nice to see him out there it's just listening to music with the robot started the interaction voting angry lately night angry yellow unsure and then let the interaction in the Green Zone


- **Note 40** (17.06, note #9 that day): Okay say the interaction that was just had was part of the filming and the interaction was kind of led by Ian with the students while filming is happening. Ian is going to like guiding through the interactions encouraging students off during the talking phase with her to discuss like how they felt away and some of these responses where stop talking about pepper telling story again open pepper


- **Note 46** (17.06, note #15 that day): About the interaction that is happened at kids grove approached the robot clicked happy on the move board despite being very clearly angry and stating explicitly that he was feeling angry there was another student at the same time who responded I think on behalf of the first student as angry and the final emotion cheque


- **Note 63** (18.06, note #8 that day): Really interesting interaction there given up to the robot and said I'm actually getting a little bit angry interacting with the mood board and there's another child nearby and I think that are interacting with the robot here selected just listen and while the 2nd child approached he said go away and having private chat with pepper


- **Note 66** (18.06, note #11 that day): Another interaction where students similar to yesterday had gone out the classroom being quite stressed open physically I guess agitated and preceded to interact with the robot initially selected calm sounds that played the waterfall sandwiches like “no no no not the toilet sound” and preceded to play calm music and listen for a little bit and then return to the classroom. [Student L]


- **Note 69** (18.06, note #14 that day): The last interaction the the kids that and then asked how they were that they were he was excited an that when the robot responded to be that being clicked this with the yellow not great thing things like some confusion as these areas like feeling good rather than kind of not great [Student L] [TIMESTAMP]


- **Note 94** (22.06, note #3 that day): Yes from the last interaction continued charging at the classroom somewhat agitated interacted with the robot a member of staff joined them in kind of guided an got it student three day interaction listened about half the story and before before heading off


- **Note 106** (22.06, note #14 that day): The interaction that this happened was one of the regulars he's considered a couple of times it's in the situations in and getting there today but that is angry and selected the calm sound but then left


- **Note 121** (23.06, note #3 that day): Note about that last interaction kid said angry both times but then said verbally to me that he's choosing at random [Student X]


- **Note 138** (23.06, note #21 that day): So that last interaction Ann was biggest thing that's not really interacted much with pepper before like a little bit then reach Mount Vernon and his mission is available agitated liberabit interacting with some insert of the students as man the corridor and number started hating like that engage with this gentleman about and then while interacting pan preceded to use the listening function and selling paper about I began with asking her for help afterwards whether that was having a good day or bad day and with a little bit of prompting from the teacher an then told Pepper' about his day and it was never a great day then proceded with couple of other activities but left the interaction seemingly a lot calmer than he initially started it.


- **Note 151** (24.06, note #1 that day): Interaction was primarily staff with the student company but it's still get out emotional in that time


- **Note 190** (29.06, note #5 that day): So about that last interaction that was Student X one of our regulars once again he says that the answering angry on the last thing wasn't accident


- **Note 194** (29.06, note #9 that day): okay that last interacting was Student X again and selects the angry but he doesn't seem to show any anger or he says oops and it was an accident and say something to bear in mind while analysing results


- **Note 198** (29.06, note #13 that day): Student L interacting with the robot again and not quite sure what emotion is selected I think it was possibly blue at the start and start the dance got of walked away possibly because another student walked by not quite sure


- **Note 215** (30.06, note #8 that day): And then when I believe it so this came out I'm suffocating is very bad man did the calm dance and sightlessness become music while the calm music was playing he walked off and returned to class and it didn't seem to clear like agitated or anything prior to coming out and not quite entirely sure is motivation was this seemed pretty calm afterwards as well


- **Note 246** (01.07, note #9 that day): Hey so that last interaction was Student L notable that he's picked yellow verbally saying that he was excited an Amazon in the Pepper responded with so you are not feeling too good he was like no no delete I'm excited again


- **Note 247** (01.07, note #10 that day): That was Student L her quest to carefully picked out some calming music and as it started playing at him from the left to return to the classroom


- **Note 260** (02.07, note #3 that day): And that last interaction was Student X and he selected sad intentionally at the end an other he's got like echoing the behave like the various behaviours in much the same way that he does win it he self selects the angry one he said he specifically chose that one because like he's physically said I chose sad because because you're going [you’re going was directed] towards pepper


- **Note 273** (02.07, note #16 that day): Student F say goodbye to the robot she said that she chose because she was sad about the robot going



### Unstructured/playful

- **Note 57** (18.06, note #2 that day): In the last interaction we had three girls interacting with a robot they it's kind of I've seen previously where 11 films of start interacting with very bullet kind of encourage others to join in and daring each other to hug the robot


- **Note 61** (18.06, note #6 that day): General note about that last interaction and it was a group of girls again once again kind of using the as a kind of centre interactions orders each other about the report an interesting one of the codes and was initially quite scared I think at the start of the week maybe even earlier today, but by the end of this interaction was kind of spontaneously saying things like cool things like an is beautiful and petting the robot on the head saying that likes to be straight on the head and other things giving it lots of cuddles being generally quite affectionate towards the robot.


- **Note 96** (22.06, note #5 that day): OK so last interaction was third that time and then that student admitted Student G had interacted with the robot this morning and he ends up cycling to do dance is an interesting more general observation is that he quite happily dances along with the robot and not necessarily following the robot still still dancing with robot and the interesting sometimes when the older group of students passes via something you stop dancing it seems like he's more comfortable with just the robot express himself in that way


- **Note 126** (23.06, note #9 that day): OK so that last interaction was without any regulars there doing lots of dancing so had comments


- **Note 199** (29.06, note #14 that day): Okay that last interaction was Student X again once again saying accidentally first angry on the end press skip is on route to DT class seem to be using robot possibly as a delaying tactic to go then it's not entirely clear but the member of staff within was self asking indicated the DSO are going to finish the dance with very because it was a short dance


- **Note 201** (29.06, note #14 that day): OK so that lasted direction was Student X again again clicking angry not sure if that was intentional or not I suspect not continuously again saying about wanting head massage also get very close to of his face an reacting very strongly when this head kind of moves and inverted commas headbutts him knew line and their interaction before that last one was very first time today and doing the dances as usual


- **Note 202** (29.06, note #15 that day): That was an instruction but to the girls Student L2 just got it like in nothing yeah the girls were they're interacting with a robot just before also decorated it with a rubber snake to make it look like pepper had hair.


- **Note 203** (29.06, note #16 that day): Interaction was the duo a that seemed to come always at the end of the day they didn't really say anything to Pepper like previous times where they still said hi invite pepper that is going to be very briefly interacted with it for the dance just now


- **Note 204** (29.06, note #17 that day): We are at the end of Tuesday day one of week three, it's been another generally quiet day interactions with her person to have been predominantly driven by one student doing most of the same things and this open occasional people surpassing by saying things like that but those have been noticeably fewer than at the very start of the study otherwise most of the interactions with pepper been very positive there's not been any violence towards pepper today which is nice that is that is the end of day one week three


- **Note 212** (30.06, note #5 that day): Notes on a flyby interaction an bathroom in the other one was kind of play boxing with pepper but specifically like behind efforts so as not to engage with the robot and so yeah interesting interaction there that wasn't really an interaction it was would be logged by the robot


- **Note 214** (30.06, note #7 that day): The interaction just before the last one with Student G an that seemed to be mostly clear live while he was walking along the corridors of stopped it out of the park do little dance and then carried on



### Social (e.g. treating Pepper as a social entity)

- **Note 2** (15.06, note #3 that day): Teachers coming about one of them and earlier interaction with one of the students crouching next to the robot can't it was really nice to see the way the student was interacting with robot like being on the robots level in the same way that they try and emulate that we're trying to be on the people’s level


- **Note 3** (15.06, note #4 that day): And note on activity from early today just in case I didn't already make a note of it we did have a students of, and interact with the robot was going to crouching in front of it and then when I was doing so for laxing sounds and music and lie down next to the robot

- **Note 203** (29.06, note #16 that day): Interaction was the duo a that seemed to come always at the end of the day they didn't really say anything to Pepper like previous times where they still said hi invite pepper that is going to be very briefly interacted with it for the dance just now


- **Note 204** (29.06, note #17 that day): We are at the end of Tuesday day one of week three, it's been another generally quiet day interactions with her person to have been predominantly driven by one student doing most of the same things and this open occasional people surpassing by saying things like that but those have been noticeably fewer than at the very start of the study otherwise most of the interactions with pepper been very positive there's not been any violence towards pepper today which is nice that is that is the end of day one week three


- **Note 216** (30.06, note #9 that day): In case that last interaction was a primary student accompanied by a teacher I think they were only to another lesson an chatter going to start an still chase the dance activity and stop a company so say that gave this word answer then returned back to class which they did without any immediate incident I think the primary student is one that came to the robot once before so spontaneously an previously to talk to the robot about how he is feeling


- **Note 217** (30.06, note #10 that day): That last interaction was Student H and wonder students interacted with it and not turn the early person stayed at study and not all during the second weekend As for a couple of times interacted with it today and seemed to be kind of in passing on the way to the bathroom


- **Note 220** (30.06, note #13 that day): That last interaction was a bit of a blended one started off with Student X then Student H came out an interesting thing notice with Student X sometimes seems to be actually selecting the angry response intentionally not because he's angry but because he likes what Petter says and following that an evens of echoes and of copies that kind of gestures there pepper does when that option is selected


- **Note 229** (30.06, note #21 that day): Interaction was actually two students who had not seen interacting with pepper before I'm two relatively youngsters I think one is in currently employed


- **Note 243** (01.07, note #6 that day): Observation from last interaction with maths well as Student X was that there were students passing by in the corridor one who's not really interacted with Pepper very much but she [Student L2] was kind of watching from a distance and Student X tried to engage her to asking her but she's like looking at the robot and then a second student [Charlie?] again one after not really interacted with pepper at all kind of passed by and try to drag Student X away saying that it was dragging him away from the think he said something like a devil possessed robot an impact is still continued to talk to thin air for which the student dragging Student X away kind of justified this is a good reason Student X then returns to the two pepper to finish interaction.


- **Note 244** (01.07, note #7 that day): The flyby interaction that just happened was couple of teenagers passing by pepper and a member of staff asking what I think is possibly a new student they thought about pepper and to which their response was like what type it looks like an there's not baby like it's disgusting and then the members are asking what gender do you think pepper is to which the student responded what like you can't assume its gender


- **Note 251** (01.07, note #14 that day): OK that was an interaction with a primary student I don't think I've seen interact with pepper before was kind of accompanied by a member of staff at the whole time seem to be so 30 engaged with half a listening to the story like favourites to the end permits point member of staff asking for the student to go back to class


- **Note 262** (02.07, note #5 that day): So that was quite an interesting interaction so it started off with members of staff I think giving people a little bit of a tour in school and they were kind of interacting with it and then some students were kind of in the hallways of watching this and then after the members of staff left and students and these were sort of older teens and so lingered around the robots or looking at it a little bit of interacting with it an so saying saying we could do a lot of seeing if it was like follow their face and things like that


- **Note 264** (02.07, note #7 that day): That last interaction that was Student L again an Nigel said while passing by he had teachers or negotiating with the weather about whether we wanted to spend some time with the robot [or go back to class] an yeah seems to be a fairly calm interaction


- **Note 265** (02.07, note #8 that day): So that last interaction was a primary student accompanied by a member of staff I not sure they've interacted with pepper before and yes very short and sweet interaction and yeah


- **Note 272** (02.07, note #15 that day): And see at that last interaction was the duo there often came to say hi to pepper at the end of the day so they were just saying goodbye to Pepper and one of them said I will miss you


- **Note 275** (02.07, note #18 that day): One of the questions from the [older] teens was about the red dot in the eye and what is it doing and a little bit about how much the robot cost they speculated a little bit on So what every box role could be in the school said one of them saying about would it be a T like could it be a teacher why would it be a teacher and there's a bit of conversations all between the students about what the right robot role and could be whether it would be a good teacher or not there there wasn't a huge amount of actual discussion as to what would about the robot would make it a good teacher or not but one of them was like yeah of course and the other was like really kind of unconvinced by this


- **Note 279** (02.07, note #22 that day): interaction around 11.40am was Student X, Student J was present in the corridor, some interaction between the two, with Student X playing/ taunting Student J by dancing along to the robot/ play punching towards Student J.



### Hidden interactions (e.g. watching Pepper from a distance)

- **Note 0** (15.06, note #1 that day): Few occasions where one negative gets been interacting with the robot there's been more ends of corridor area looking on I just kind of watching exactly


- **Note 24** (16.06, note #4 that day): Going into the Glaser day three other observations that we still getting lots of people saying hi and bye to pepper as they passed by even if they don't interact with the robot via the screen at all


- **Note 38** (17.06, note #7 that day): General observations still getting people saying hi pepper just in passing without necessarily engaging with the way thought or standing long enough to be a full engagement


- **Note 60** (18.06, note #5 that day): General note on interactions with the very bar and something that I've seen quite a lot of is students interacting with the robot and they will then continue the interaction but they will often observe Pepper from a bit of a distance [while the robot] does whatever it's doing


- **Note 70** (18.06, note #15 that day): And a student and stuff so far past the robot and they were passing by they didn't interact directly with the interface that they did so move and watch rebook watch the robot for a couple of minutes and happily up conversation about there's a add team here effects to help her as I think sweetheart


- **Note 74** (18.06, note #19 that day): Not quite a question that students are passed by instead as I don't know why is looking at me and another student passing by responded that it was just the robot was just looking around


- **Note 86** (21.06, note #5 that day): Student L did try to interact with the robot as seen on previous days, but the tablet glitched so had to be reset before he could finish the interaction


- **Note 87** (21.06, note #6 that day):  penultimate interaction of the day was group interaction with the girls, there were a few standing around observing while the others interacted with the robot.


- **Note 90** (21.06, note #9 that day): interestingly there was no interaction at all today from some students (Student J2, Student H, Student E2) who had on the first few days spent hours with the robot. Definitely starting to see a shift in regulars (Student L, Student G).


- **Note 96** (22.06, note #5 that day): OK so last interaction was third that time and then that student admitted Student G had interacted with the robot this morning and he ends up cycling to do dance is an interesting more general observation is that he quite happily dances along with the robot and not necessarily following the robot still still dancing with robot and the interesting sometimes when the older group of students passes via something you stop dancing it seems like he's more comfortable with just the robot express himself in that way


- **Note 98** (22.06, note #6 that day): Quick interaction a social interaction but I fly by interaction with students over working past saying that robot scares them and that's because I looked at them an wait last a little bit more about that an elaborated saying that it was [because] the robot doesn't blink


- **Note 118** (22.06, note #26 that day): general note - many children start interactions with the robot and then move away, then move closer in again to resume interaction.


- **Note 147** (24.06, note #1 that day): Quick passing remark by with student was the comparing pepper to fivenightsatfreddys way it looks like you


- **Note 153** (24.06, note #1 that day): Bye bye interaction Student X one of the robots regulars and which is well past wielding trophy and showed it to Pepper on route


- **Note 159** (24.06, note #1 that day): One towers was interacting with the robot another pass by and asked are you having a date


- **Note 160** (24.06, note #1 that day): In case I last word didn't record properly child as well passed for another one interacting with the robot asked the interactive whether they're on a date the robot


- **Note 174** (25.06, note #3 that day): We just had a flyby interaction hi to Pepper while passing by also commented that both he said how cool is that at directing towards pepper


- **Note 192** (29.06, note #7 that day): Flyby interaction from Student M touching the screen while walking by although the screen didn't engage he just continued walking


- **Note 196** (29.06, note #11 that day): OK so general notes on the morning it's been pretty quiet again there's been a few flyby interaction with safe love interactions slavery comments directed towards the robot often from students that haven't really interacted with the robot much insert passing comment saying it's a little bit creepy there is a kind of been consistent throughout throughout the study um other interactions have been mostly filled by the same two or three students and yet we are about to break for lunch at half 12 that's it now


- **Note 212** (30.06, note #5 that day): Notes on a flyby interaction an bathroom in the other one was kind of play boxing with pepper but specifically like behind efforts so as not to engage with the robot and so yeah interesting interaction there that wasn't really an interaction it was would be logged by the robot


- **Note 243** (01.07, note #6 that day): Observation from last interaction with maths well as Student X was that there were students passing by in the corridor one who's not really interacted with Pepper very much but she [Student L2] was kind of watching from a distance and Student X tried to engage her to asking her but she's like looking at the robot and then a second student [Charlie?] again one after not really interacted with pepper at all kind of passed by and try to drag Student X away saying that it was dragging him away from the think he said something like a devil possessed robot an impact is still continued to talk to thin air for which the student dragging Student X away kind of justified this is a good reason Student X then returns to the two pepper to finish interaction.


- **Note 244** (01.07, note #7 that day): The flyby interaction that just happened was couple of teenagers passing by pepper and a member of staff asking what I think is possibly a new student they thought about pepper and to which their response was like what type it looks like an there's not baby like it's disgusting and then the members are asking what gender do you think pepper is to which the student responded what like you can't assume its gender


- **Note 263** (02.07, note #6 that day): Cycle fly by interaction between Student H saying hi to pepper



### Comments about Pepper (e.g. things they liked/disliked about Pepper, interpretations of the robot's behaviour)

- **Note 1** (15.06, note #2 that day): Still getting some comments from students mostly teen students I think saying that it's quite creepy


- **Note 10** (15.06, note #11 that day): Related to some teens finding the robot creepy, some asking why is it looking at me


- **Note 16** (15.06, note #17 that day): concerns about the future, becoming robots


- **Note 33** (17.06, note #2 that day): General chat and with one of the students I was about the robot and kind of talking about it doing the dancing quite like the dance and delete how long it takes to make a robot and and what kind of things we should do.


- **Note 34** (17.06, note #3 that day):  Follow ups the last comment was the quite often asking about what you think about should do and things like that word kind of it with a general shrug and I don't know yeah generally seems to be a fan of the dance aspects


- **Note 37** (17.06, note #6 that day): Comment from a member of staff about one of the holding the hand of the robot and saying that normally they have not physical touch


- **Note 41** (17.06, note #10 that day): And it wouldn't get the things in the last interaction as well they were talking bout will be good if we could do games again suggested included monopoly I think yeah it was


- **Note 42** (17.06, note #11 that day): Corridors along busy at the moment as the delete results were said kind of walking past with this stuff and observation is there still a few students referring to it as being creepy they tend still to be the older students small incident just now add teaching school past and say you're crazy you know


- **Note 43** (17.06, note #12 that day): And the last interaction upon hearing the jokes the teens interacted with it decided the robot wasn't very good.


- **Note 44** (17.06, note #13 that day): The last one the last interaction that was just had was also a young teen, upon hearing the jokes [the robot] was declared a legend.


- **Note 59** (18.06, note #4 that day): To continue from notes made earlier about the group of girls interacting with the robot just before lunch with the kind of cuddles and things we had a little bit of a chat about how long the robot was going to be there for and one of them was saying how they really liked pepper and burns last like what do you like about the bird that was really cool really advanced an yeah that sound like they would like to have a pepper at home Anne I believe I believe that was all that was said in that interaction


- **Note 61** (18.06, note #6 that day): General note about that last interaction and it was a group of girls again once again kind of using the as a kind of centre interactions orders each other about the report an interesting one of the codes and was initially quite scared I think at the start of the week maybe even earlier today, but by the end of this interaction was kind of spontaneously saying things like cool things like an is beautiful and petting the robot on the head saying that likes to be straight on the head and other things giving it lots of cuddles being generally quite affectionate towards the robot.


- **Note 63** (18.06, note #8 that day): Really interesting interaction there given up to the robot and said I'm actually getting a little bit angry interacting with the mood board and there's another child nearby and I think that are interacting with the robot here selected just listen and while the 2nd child approached he said go away and having private chat with pepper


- **Note 73** (18.06, note #18 that day): In the relation to the question about how many people are staying at the school for it then it is going to be here for three weeks assisting what they thought about pepper staying for that long whether they would want the robot to stay for longer or not she was funded that yes she thought pepper was alright


- **Note 74** (18.06, note #19 that day): Not quite a question that students are passed by instead as I don't know why is looking at me and another student passing by responded that it was just the robot was just looking around


- **Note 76** (18.06, note #21 that day): Last interaction as well there talking about the listening function on the interface and asked about why we do include a listening activity if it can't respond


- **Note 81** (18.06, note #18 that day): spoke about the robot being similar to another animatronic that he found creepy [did not specify what animatronic when asked], then continued to compare it demons etc.


- **Note 88** (21.06, note #7 that day): – they [Student L2, Student E, Student O(?)] asked again about the robot's gender. Asking them what they thought, one responded that she thought it was a girl because the name 'pepper' sounded feminine.


- **Note 98** (22.06, note #6 that day): Quick interaction a social interaction but I fly by interaction with students over working past saying that robot scares them and that's because I looked at them an wait last a little bit more about that an elaborated saying that it was [because] the robot doesn't blink


- **Note 107** (22.06, note #15 that day): 358 incident child walking around with a member of staff saying something about asking them to destroy the robot and [as] she will pass, threw like she threw a scrunched up tissue at the robot. [she seemed to be storming past with some anger.]


- **Note 108** (22.06, note #16 that day): And in question by the student is she passing by why you looking at me and also the comment was that you're creepy towards directed towards the robot


- **Note 114** (22.06, note #22 that day): questioned how I controlled the robot, explained about the programme running on the tablet, lil m compared to it being like  an x box controller.


- **Note 115** (22.06, note #23 that day): lil m spoke again about the robot having a vacuum fitted so the robot could clean


- **Note 117** (22.06, note #25 that day): general note - children's interpretations of the eyes changing colour - pink eye is often associated with anger or that the robot requires charge


- **Note 126** (23.06, note #9 that day): OK so that last interaction was without any regulars there doing lots of dancing so had comments


- **Note 139** (23.06, note #22 that day): One child asking if you could put the robot or otherwise damage it can I ask if it be possible to take off the head of the robot and robot keep keep functioning and updates with a little bit of conversation so that it can't do that that you think maybe that might be something that would be useful for future reports today I didn't get a clear response from that but it was kind of interesting the concept of a robot that could help solve detachable parts and still function


- **Note 147** (24.06, note #1 that day): Quick passing remark by with student was the comparing pepper to fivenightsatfreddys way it looks like you


- **Note 169** (24.06, note #1 that day): when asked about touching the robot's head, Student F said she liked it a lot.


- **Note 170** (24.06, note #1 that day): Student J still expressing active dislike towards the robot comparing it to a demon and various other things


- **Note 174** (25.06, note #3 that day): We just had a flyby interaction hi to Pepper while passing by also commented that both he said how cool is that at directing towards pepper


- **Note 196** (29.06, note #11 that day): OK so general notes on the morning it's been pretty quiet again there's been a few flyby interaction with safe love interactions slavery comments directed towards the robot often from students that haven't really interacted with the robot much insert passing comment saying it's a little bit creepy there is a kind of been consistent throughout throughout the study um other interactions have been mostly filled by the same two or three students and yet we are about to break for lunch at half 12 that's it now


- **Note 219** (30.06, note #12 that day): OK so that last interaction was Student X again we had a little bit of a chat while he was interacting with robots and he asked when Pepper was leaving, I said Friday and there was a little bit of a look of a sadness about it. asking did he would you miss pepper and he said yes and asked what you like about paper and he said specifically I like fun dances.


- **Note 241** (01.07, note #4 that day): Okay so that was that last interaction was Student X wheelchair about the robot what you like to help with really but why he like to visit to which the answer was primarily that because it's a robot an we talked a little bit about the dances and which ones he kinda like the most the saxophone is hello by far the favourite and


- **Note 242** (01.07, note #5 that day): This interaction and it was an Student X again, and again asking for a book the hidden said a little bit about missing the robot after once it's gone.


- **Note 243** (01.07, note #6 that day): Observation from last interaction with maths well as Student X was that there were students passing by in the corridor one who's not really interacted with Pepper very much but she [Student L2] was kind of watching from a distance and Student X tried to engage her to asking her but she's like looking at the robot and then a second student [Charlie?] again one after not really interacted with pepper at all kind of passed by and try to drag Student X away saying that it was dragging him away from the think he said something like a devil possessed robot an impact is still continued to talk to thin air for which the student dragging Student X away kind of justified this is a good reason Student X then returns to the two pepper to finish interaction.


- **Note 244** (01.07, note #7 that day): The flyby interaction that just happened was couple of teenagers passing by pepper and a member of staff asking what I think is possibly a new student they thought about pepper and to which their response was like what type it looks like an there's not baby like it's disgusting and then the members are asking what gender do you think pepper is to which the student responded what like you can't assume its gender


- **Note 256** (01.07, note #19 that day): Interaction from Student H asking pepper how well if if it's alright and from the how do you think pepper is and he said he thinks that is great


- **Note 275** (02.07, note #18 that day): One of the questions from the [older] teens was about the red dot in the eye and what is it doing and a little bit about how much the robot cost they speculated a little bit on So what every box role could be in the school said one of them saying about would it be a T like could it be a teacher why would it be a teacher and there's a bit of conversations all between the students about what the right robot role and could be whether it would be a good teacher or not there there wasn't a huge amount of actual discussion as to what would about the robot would make it a good teacher or not but one of them was like yeah of course and the other was like really kind of unconvinced by this


- **Note 282** (02.07, note #25 that day): - discussion with Student E2 about this being Pepper's last day, asking why the robot is going, wanting it to stay, I asked why and the response was "it's fun" (Student E2 hasn't directly interacted with the robot very often other than to attempt to move it around).



### Touch (e.g. holding Pepper's hand, moving Pepper, stroking Pepper's head, hugs, does NOT include touching the interface)

- **Note 37** (17.06, note #6 that day): Comment from a member of staff about one of the holding the hand of the robot and saying that normally they have not physical touch


- **Note 47** (17.06, note #16 that day): Yeah the robot just went on a little bit of a trip with the students decided to push it a little bit rather than fully interacting with it [using the screen].


- **Note 57** (18.06, note #2 that day): In the last interaction we had three girls interacting with a robot they it's kind of I've seen previously where 11 films of start interacting with very bullet kind of encourage others to join in and daring each other to hug the robot


- **Note 58** (18.06, note #3 that day): Okay so bunch and it's about that last interaction started off with one kid and then the others kind of joined in an 3 girls and lots of cuddles though is we had a bit of a chat about the robot yeah and then yeah we've had a chat about the boat they were saying about pepper home ask then pet peppers turned off right now and is going away to be charged over lunch just for now what is that


- **Note 59** (18.06, note #4 that day): To continue from notes made earlier about the group of girls interacting with the robot just before lunch with the kind of cuddles and things we had a little bit of a chat about how long the robot was going to be there for and one of them was saying how they really liked pepper and burns last like what do you like about the bird that was really cool really advanced an yeah that sound like they would like to have a pepper at home Anne I believe I believe that was all that was said in that interaction


- **Note 61** (18.06, note #6 that day): General note about that last interaction and it was a group of girls again once again kind of using the as a kind of centre interactions orders each other about the report an interesting one of the codes and was initially quite scared I think at the start of the week maybe even earlier today, but by the end of this interaction was kind of spontaneously saying things like cool things like an is beautiful and petting the robot on the head saying that likes to be straight on the head and other things giving it lots of cuddles being generally quite affectionate towards the robot.


- **Note 64** (18.06, note #9 that day): And follow on from the previous log previous incident that the interaction that just happened that was the singer returning back to pepper once the corridor had cleared a little but there still allocates kind of in and out an interestingly also when the robot was doing the calm dance rather than following the dance when pepper kind of like open its arms they could give the robot hug


- **Note 67** (18.06, note #12 that day): The last interaction was a couple of girls from their primary side of school and started of interacting with a robot listen to the jokes listen to the story and were engaged through the entirety of the story one of them was taking Pepper’s hand feeling the hand and they got centre story and left with their members [of] staff


- **Note 91** (21.06, note #10 that day): - some students ask about why pepper's arm isn't moving - there seems to be some issue with one (though never the same arm) stopping occasionally. [After some investigation, this is likely to be a safety feature of Pepper. The robot stops moving when it encounters an obstacle and students frequently get very close to Pepper or touch the robot while in motion.]


- **Note 105** (22.06, note #13 that day): General notes the end of the day today it seems to have been bit quieter than had been a first week still but not more than yesterday and reasonable flows students coming in and out things I've noticed since having Inns training yesterday is is the number of students all contracting global and the touches on the head and the hands I'd notice then hand touches previously there is like a lock students tend to do that and while interacting with the robot yeah I will pretty positive daily interactions with the robot yes


- **Note 113** (22.06, note #21 that day): lil m interaction, he gets very close to the robot [practically touching nose to nose], staring into peppers eye (possibly at the red light in one eye?)


- **Note 169** (24.06, note #1 that day): when asked about touching the robot's head, Student F said she liked it a lot.


- **Note 183** (25.06, note #12 that day): Brief incident with one student [Student J2] in the classroom and punching Pepper twice in the face not particularly hard but with frustration


- **Note 201** (29.06, note #14 that day): OK so that lasted direction was Student X again again clicking angry not sure if that was intentional or not I suspect not continuously again saying about wanting head massage also get very close to of his face an reacting very strongly when this head kind of moves and inverted commas headbutts him knew line and their interaction before that last one was very first time today and doing the dances as usual


- **Note 210** (30.06, note #3 that day): Another note out Student X's interactions and pretty much every time he comes out to the road stop he self puts his head enter like the robots hands off asking for his head massage and not entirely clear why he asked for this I have asked him and there's not really been an actual response


- **Note 225** (30.06, note #18 that day): OK so that previous that last interaction was Student X again kind of interacting with variable barely standard for Student X interaction yeah lots of insistence on being very close to pepper and to the point of getting headbutted repeatedly and yeah but he sentence is so focused behind head massage then yeah


- **Note 230** (30.06, note #22 that day): So create much better last interaction that was where he called Student E2 he's interacted with the robot a little bit before and that most of the time this is to play with the charging socket to start moving pepper around which is why the programme had to be briefly paused because doing so substation running properly


- **Note 270** (02.07, note #13 that day): They are those last interactions were Student X and Student F saying goodbye to pepper their attempting to get to the Reebok hugged identify actually need it



### Questions

- **Note 51** (17.06, note #20 that day): From earlier the question about what is the red light in the eye this is a question that has come up a couple of times but just in case haven't recorded previously


- **Note 52** (17.06, note #21 that day): Quick question was can tap remove


- **Note 53** (17.06, note #21 that day): requesting from the last interaction said do you think we was in the future will be more sentient and move around more


- **Note 71** (18.06, note #16 that day): Familiar question of why you looking at me as while walking past an [directed towards robot]


- **Note 72** (18.06, note #17 that day): That was a question from the last interaction whether the Pepper with behave like a human and also asked about the materials that it was made of yeah we still had looked out the bins up made of plastic and it being a prototype that's how the student described it being like a prototype for verilux in the future and also ask questions about whether the hands could change into other tools such as a sword for example he knows about everything


- **Note 73** (18.06, note #18 that day): In the relation to the question about how many people are staying at the school for it then it is going to be here for three weeks assisting what they thought about pepper staying for that long whether they would want the robot to stay for longer or not she was funded that yes she thought pepper was alright


- **Note 74** (18.06, note #19 that day): Not quite a question that students are passed by instead as I don't know why is looking at me and another student passing by responded that it was just the robot was just looking around


- **Note 75** (18.06, note #20 that day): An the following from the interaction with the with the three girls in transmitter but they're asking what gender is pepper this has become quite a common question from both students and staff


- **Note 76** (18.06, note #21 that day): Last interaction as well there talking about the listening function on the interface and asked about why we do include a listening activity if it can't respond


- **Note 77** (18.06, note #22 that day): It was a brief question of what would happen if the dog at the school met pepper


- **Note 78** (18.06, note #23 that day): Didn't again correctly with people students last year how are you upper how are you doing affoom one


- **Note 79** (18.06, note #24 that day): jack again requested that the robot be moved, was the most calm request so far.


- **Note 84** (21.06, note #3 that day): lots of questions about how pepper moves (in terms of physical movement, what pepper is made of, how much does pepper cost)


- **Note 88** (21.06, note #7 that day): – they [Student L2, Student E, Student O(?)] asked again about the robot's gender. Asking them what they thought, one responded that she thought it was a girl because the name 'pepper' sounded feminine.


- **Note 91** (21.06, note #10 that day): - some students ask about why pepper's arm isn't moving - there seems to be some issue with one (though never the same arm) stopping occasionally. [After some investigation, this is likely to be a safety feature of Pepper. The robot stops moving when it encounters an obstacle and students frequently get very close to Pepper or touch the robot while in motion.]


- **Note 102** (22.06, note #10 that day): Note on the last of interaction continued that student had been walking past and then returns to access his locker but hadn't really interacted with and pepper before yeah we had a little bit discussion about what paper was doing what papers looking at


- **Note 103** (22.06, note #11 that day): Note on the last interaction continued we had a little conversation about what papers doing what capitalise looking at


- **Note 108** (22.06, note #16 that day): And in question by the student is she passing by why you looking at me and also the comment was that you're creepy towards directed towards the robot


- **Note 109** (22.06, note #17 that day): Question about why the eyes are blue which results without that means it's listening


- **Note 110** (22.06, note #18 that day): Question about what is paper looking at and what is he doing


- **Note 111** (22.06, note #19 that day): Just as well about how how are you


- **Note 112** (22.06, note #20 that day): Question about whether it is possible to have conversations with peppermint perfekten understand


- **Note 114** (22.06, note #22 that day): questioned how I controlled the robot, explained about the programme running on the tablet, lil m compared to it being like  an x box controller.


- **Note 116** (22.06, note #24 that day): does it need charge?


- **Note 139** (23.06, note #22 that day): One child asking if you could put the robot or otherwise damage it can I ask if it be possible to take off the head of the robot and robot keep keep functioning and updates with a little bit of conversation so that it can't do that that you think maybe that might be something that would be useful for future reports today I didn't get a clear response from that but it was kind of interesting the concept of a robot that could help solve detachable parts and still function


- **Note 161** (24.06, note #1 that day): The great question about erm why is it making up the ‘ow’ sound when he gets pushed not the best every button did anyway and when it made that noise and that was when that question arose


- **Note 163** (24.06, note #1 that day): Long conversation with Student J he had quite a lot of questions about the robots alright why where was it made why does it follow sounds why is that resonates I last questions about the report and also asking why it was here whether we could move it along with the usual questions to express his displeasure at the robot being here. The upshot hold having some of those questions I think maybe helped a little bit


- **Note 164** (24.06, note #1 that day): Questions from primary group included was it made of one of the kids it was made of metal and go explain to them that it might have pieces inside why isn't it coated in plastic human interaction


- **Note 167** (24.06, note #1 that day): max asked why it had red in its eye


- **Note 184** (25.06, note #13 that day): So we just have a question for did from primary class via teacher and they're asking what happens to pepper at the end of the day does it stay on, does it will contender and identity child than it get turn off at the end of day and goes on charge so I think she might go back to the class to pass that on


- **Note 185** (25.06, note #14 that day): And Student M2 said question and say well interacting with reporters now standing a little bit away and asked why the robot was looking at him explained that it's sort of looking around randomly and could also be looking for where there is sound


- **Note 206** (29.06, note #19 that day): Question directed towards the robot while passing by and student haven't really interacted with the robot a huge amount but passed by 10s of look back at very both and would like a thumbs up asking you right


- **Note 207** (29.06, note #20 that day): Student X is a thing had the when Pepper would come back having learned that the robot was leaving at the end of this week


- **Note 226** (30.06, note #19 that day): General note for today so far it's definitely busier than the past couple of days and there's been a new school kind of theme to the questions being asked of like how long is Pepper staying and is Friday the last day


- **Note 233** (30.06, note #25 that day): Question in the last interaction was about when pepper was leaving and with seemingly at some trepidation about pepper leaving in the near future


- **Note 234** (30.06, note #26 that day): There's another question about the robots last day just now from a different student who has interacted with the robot a huge amount


- **Note 235** (30.06, note #27 that day): Was having trouble booting up Lily looking over and asked of pepper was okay a couple of members of staff also asked what was going on with pepper


- **Note 236** (30.06, note #28 that day): Open interaction with the team needs students or new to pepper students they're asking lots of questions about whether help you could high five with it happen neither time but the Packard opened the doors that so yeah please those are the kind of main questions still questions about Pepper’s capabilities


- **Note 237** (30.06, note #29 that day): Gives us asking me that like how are you add directed towards the robot


- **Note 255** (01.07, note #18 that day): Barkley in that last interaction with various though and she's [Student F] asking about how old pepper is Anne she needed a chat about the fact that pepper was about six years old made in 2014. Student H is age to phrase age


- **Note 256** (01.07, note #19 that day): Interaction from Student H asking pepper how well if if it's alright and from the how do you think pepper is and he said he thinks that is great


- **Note 275** (02.07, note #18 that day): One of the questions from the [older] teens was about the red dot in the eye and what is it doing and a little bit about how much the robot cost they speculated a little bit on So what every box role could be in the school said one of them saying about would it be a T like could it be a teacher why would it be a teacher and there's a bit of conversations all between the students about what the right robot role and could be whether it would be a good teacher or not there there wasn't a huge amount of actual discussion as to what would about the robot would make it a good teacher or not but one of them was like yeah of course and the other was like really kind of unconvinced by this


- **Note 276** (02.07, note #19 that day): In that last interaction the primary student also in the listening activity ask her how are you


- **Note 277** (02.07, note #20 that day): Rolling Pepper out for this afternoon Student X was asking again about it being that this last day with Pepper would and come back go to another school which kind of didn't know yet if you win that would come back to the school go to any other schools


- **Note 278** (02.07, note #21 that day): He [Student X or Student E2 I think] was asked where the robot was going after the study as I said she [echoing student’s choice of pronouns for Pepper] was getting back to the Bristol robotics lab so we keep doing some kind of research with it.


- **Note 282** (02.07, note #25 that day): - discussion with Student E2 about this being Pepper's last day, asking why the robot is going, wanting it to stay, I asked why and the response was "it's fun" (Student E2 hasn't directly interacted with the robot very often other than to attempt to move it around).



### Things that affecting the data collection (e.g. media days, testing/demonstrating things, robot errors, non-responsive interface)

- **Note 6** (15.06, note #7 that day): final response to the feeling was also random


- **Note 7** (15.06, note #8 that day): Turn it's just a short interaction there could approach that and the screen didn't respond so immediately left again


- **Note 28** (16.06, note #8 that day): the interaction just a minute ago was a member of staff just trying up he thing to see what it did


- **Note 32** (17.06, note #1 that day): A quick note about today apparently the Duke of Edinburgh trips going on so there's fewer kids in school today this is a


- **Note 35** (17.06, note #4 that day): About the interactions that have just been occuring these were with the camera crew from uwe and the media team so just as a notes of the interactions but not being quite as natural as they would be normally [9.37am]


- **Note 36** (17.06, note #5 that day): So just quick note the camera crew has moved away for now and so yeah from the last recording to this one those interactions were with the media team present [9.58am]


- **Note 39** (17.06, note #8 that day): Quickly about the last interaction that was also done for the media team [TIMESTAMP]


- **Note 40** (17.06, note #9 that day): Okay say the interaction that was just had was part of the filming and the interaction was kind of led by Ian with the students while filming is happening. Ian is going to like guiding through the interactions encouraging students off during the talking phase with her to discuss like how they felt away and some of these responses where stop talking about pepper telling story again open pepper


- **Note 54** (17.06, note #21 that day): robot was started early to minimise surprise factor of the robot appearing later in the day.


- **Note 56** (18.06, note #1 that day): So busy busier than yesterday so we might get more interactions today than yesterday


- **Note 69** (18.06, note #14 that day): The last interaction the the kids that and then asked how they were that they were he was excited an that when the robot responded to be that being clicked this with the yellow not great thing things like some confusion as these areas like feeling good rather than kind of not great [Student L] [TIMESTAMP]


- **Note 86** (21.06, note #5 that day): Student L did try to interact with the robot as seen on previous days, but the tablet glitched so had to be reset before he could finish the interaction


- **Note 89** (21.06, note #8 that day): final story interaction of the day was nigel recording video for the presentation for autistic adults.


- **Note 99** (22.06, note #7 that day): This is the end of the morning session for day 7 and we have been a reason about of activity definitely busier than previous day and yeah we had a lot of interactions where it's been the same couple of kids interacting with the robots for extended periods yeah say the system [TIMESTAMP]


- **Note 100** (22.06, note #8 that day): OK just quick log that we are back after lunch just to the corridors are currently quite quiet and yeah we'll get to go through this afternoon [TIMESTAMP]

- **Note 127** (23.06, note #10 that day): Yet create about that last interaction and that was a couple of of the school governors visiting and just kind of now to showing them around so that was not a child interacting with the robot [TIMESTAMP]


- **Note 128** (23.06, note #11 that day): Last interaction an that was also with the governor so we can screen out that last interaction [TIMESTAMP]


- **Note 129** (23.06, note #12 that day): But we are about to stop from lunch at the robot on charge it is 12:30


- **Note 130** (23.06, note #13 that day): OK we are back after lunch it is 20 past one


- **Note 131** (23.06, note #14 that day): Notes on the last couple of interactions the one for the last one that just happened was an what about miraculous

- **Note 149** (24.06, note #1 that day): Okay quick note about the last interaction that was a class of primary [TIMESTAMP]


- **Note 150** (24.06, note #1 that day): Last interaction was a group of primary students interacting in the robot


- **Note 151** (24.06, note #1 that day): Interaction was primarily staff with the student company but it's still get out emotional in that time


- **Note 152** (24.06, note #1 that day): Generally not today and as David moderaterna furs or passing by some fried pepper and hired by together


- **Note 154** (24.06, note #1 that day): It is 2:50 something it is the end of school day two corridors are pretty much empty overall oxidations of the day has been generally pretty quiet and there was a class visit I think I was the biggest group of the day. majority have been one or two interacting with the robot at time yeah generally the interactions were pretty positive there is no real life balance word sorry bout today an yeah it's pretty pretty joke


- **Note 155** (24.06, note #1 that day): The interaction just now was a primary student I think


- **Note 156** (24.06, note #1 that day): The interaction just now was a primary student who either intentionally or otherwise like ended up insert with a very bot and started interacting


- **Note 158** (24.06, note #1 that day): A quick erase question for myself like my interaction with whether the robot reset an explained about if we should go through the full interaction with the robot that it would go back to the start and that at the start of each day we restart the robot


- **Note 162** (24.06, note #1 that day): I had a quite long conversation with Student J and he's asking


- **Note 165** (24.06, note #1 that day): lunch started late around 1pm, restarted robot at 1.30pm


- **Note 172** (25.06, note #1 that day): First interaction today that was Louis [TIMESTAMP]


- **Note 173** (25.06, note #2 that day): I set up about half eight this morning


- **Note 177** (25.06, note #6 that day): Quick note about that last interaction that was Student X again and again accidentally clicked angry rather than the error


- **Note 178** (25.06, note #7 that day): Okay lunch word half 12/2


- **Note 179** (25.06, note #8 that day): Lunch was after October 1 an the last in


- **Note 186** (29.06, note #1 that day): OK general notes for today we are on Tuesday of week 3 yesterday was an inset day so there is no data for Monday we are about to start it is 8:30 in the morning no students are in currently we go


- **Note 190** (29.06, note #5 that day): So about that last interaction that was Student X one of our regulars once again he says that the answering angry on the last thing wasn't accident


- **Note 194** (29.06, note #9 that day): okay that last interacting was Student X again and selects the angry but he doesn't seem to show any anger or he says oops and it was an accident and say something to bear in mind while analysing results


- **Note 197** (29.06, note #12 that day): Okay general log we are back after lunch is well quarter past one the corridors are quiet we just served and are ready to go


- **Note 208** (30.06, note #1 that day): [Wednesday] week three can we just started at 8:30 corridor currently quiet as students are in yet but we're all set up and ready to go


- **Note 211** (30.06, note #4 that day): OK so that last interaction was a Student F an mostly using what about singing for entertainment with the dancing also speaking at his head and throughout the interaction as well and also leaving at the centre


- **Note 218** (30.06, note #11 that day): Quickly about last interactions well it was cut short a little bit by the interface not working.


- **Note 223** (30.06, note #16 that day): Okay that last interaction was limited trying to interact with it but have a DJ for the programme on the tablet froze for a moment so we have left it with a little bit of frustration that it wasn't working


- **Note 227** (30.06, note #20 that day): We are breaking for lunch at 12:35


- **Note 228** (30.06, note #20 that day): And we are back after lunch it is about but it is 1:37 currently, Pepper was taking a long time to start up an it did come out with an error and turned it off turn it back on again seems to be fine now so we are ready to roll and continue.


- **Note 230** (30.06, note #22 that day): So create much better last interaction that was where he called Student E2 he's interacted with the robot a little bit before and that most of the time this is to play with the charging socket to start moving pepper around which is why the programme had to be briefly paused because doing so substation running properly


- **Note 238** (01.07, note #1 that day): This is Thursday of week three we set up about 8:30 since then 1 [interaction]


- **Note 240** (01.07, note #3 that day): Okay quick note about those last interactions that was during the photo shoot for the times though not the most natural interactions had there some of these were also generated from here on the tablet.


- **Note 246** (01.07, note #9 that day): Hey so that last interaction was Student L notable that he's picked yellow verbally saying that he was excited an Amazon in the Pepper responded with so you are not feeling too good he was like no no delete I'm excited again


- **Note 248** (01.07, note #11 that day): It is just before 12:30 and we just bout to pack up the robot. Generally interactions this morning have all been very positive towards the robot. There was that photo shoot so some of it will be a little bit more ready very Abou than usual so much customer that out but yeah otherwise it's been a good morning


- **Note 254** (01.07, note #17 that day): OK so we are at the end of Thursday of week three it is 2:55 there's not really been a huge amount of interaction this afternoon um but yeah will be interactions today have been pretty positive and there's been actually a couple of new new people interacting with pepper today and been mostly still regulars and yes that's bout it.


- **Note 258** (02.07, note #1 that day): OK slightly late notes on the start of the day but we did start at about 8:30 maybe about 8:20 before any students had come in


- **Note 259** (02.07, note #2 that day): Very first interaction this morning or Student M solve in passing an was still talking with phone in just like clicked pepper kind of yeah she's kind of in passing clarity interacting that much with pepper


- **Note 261** (02.07, note #4 that day): Last interaction was Student X again, and again accidentally selecting the angry rather than the arrow to skip the last question.


- **Note 262** (02.07, note #5 that day): So that was quite an interesting interaction so it started off with members of staff I think giving people a little bit of a tour in school and they were kind of interacting with it and then some students were kind of in the hallways of watching this and then after the members of staff left and students and these were sort of older teens and so lingered around the robots or looking at it a little bit of interacting with it an so saying saying we could do a lot of seeing if it was like follow their face and things like that


- **Note 267** (02.07, note #10 that day): OK it's about 5 past 12 now and we're going to put better away to charge for lunch at a little bit early today so really quickly test the the assembly things ahead of time and so yeah that is stopping at 5 past 12 today.


- **Note 268** (02.07, note #11 that day): A quick log we back We are back at 1:00 PM


- **Note 269** (02.07, note #12 that day): We've got about half an hour before the assembly so just out pPepper fill with half an hour before going in there.


- **Note 274** (02.07, note #17 that day): Just about to pack up after the robot no 22 two and yet that is that's a wrap



### Unclassfied, doesn't fit in any other category, but still interesting/useful

- **Note 4** (15.06, note #5 that day): Small interaction just now where to pick up the robot in its entirety from it's not as heavy as I thought it was or the the kids are very strong.


- **Note 8** (15.06, note #9 that day): OK last interaction we had there was and there was a lot going on and get with that being white board staff intervened team protect the robot turn on kid


- **Note 65** (18.06, note #10 that day): Last interaction was between a primary student made he's primarily using sign language and problem stop is helping and get to interact without using sign journey interaction hi T use sign language with the robots are trying to sign ‘more’ onto the papers hand everybody seems to enjoy interacting with robots and did make use of the move screen indicates up initially angry and at the end of the interaction happy he did a couple of cycles and always ended the interaction or index cycle with a happy


- **Note 68** (18.06, note #13 that day): Interaction just now was Tyler the kid with the hearing aid again and again there was lots of facilitation from member of staff to interact with the robot using sign language


- **Note 107** (22.06, note #15 that day): 358 incident child walking around with a member of staff saying something about asking them to destroy the robot and [as] she will pass, threw like she threw a scrunched up tissue at the robot. [she seemed to be storming past with some anger.]


- **Note 137** (23.06, note #20 that day): Quick note if insert we did just have a fire alarm so things may be a little bit disrupted for awhile


- **Note 266** (02.07, note #9 that day): Last interaction as well there's a little bit of mimicry of some of the sort of interjections that have it as like the kind of Yahoo Yahoo after telling a joke the people's little bit as well


- **Note 271** (02.07, note #14 that day): OK so that last interaction was Mihron and he's not really interacted with the much before I'm wondering if this is it could be related to the fact that we just had the quiz session about Pepper just now



## Specific students 


### Student F

- **Note 166** (24.06, note #1 that day): just before lunch was interaction with Student F and Student X, taking over from one another


- **Note 168** (24.06, note #1 that day): member of staff (Staff B) said that it was good to see Student F interacting with the robot so gently as she is often quite heavy handed.


- **Note 169** (24.06, note #1 that day): when asked about touching the robot's head, Student F said she liked it a lot.


- **Note 181** (25.06, note #10 that day): Last interaction was Student F that was the first today I think because of a school trip having only just returned almost immediately went to the robot [TIMESTAMP]


- **Note 221** (30.06, note #14 that day): An interesting observation also I’ve seen I think a couple of times Student F has sold then they also predicted echoing of pepper and preemptively saying her Pepper will be about to say usually things like the fun dance episode lists of the items for the activities


- **Note 239** (01.07, note #2 that day): Last interaction was Student F and as usual going again going through it answers


- **Note 255** (01.07, note #18 that day): Barkley in that last interaction with various though and she's [Student F] asking about how old pepper is Anne she needed a chat about the fact that pepper was about six years old made in 2014. Student H is age to phrase age


- **Note 270** (02.07, note #13 that day): They are those last interactions were Student X and Student F saying goodbye to pepper their attempting to get to the Reebok hugged identify actually need it


- **Note 273** (02.07, note #16 that day): Student F say goodbye to the robot she said that she chose because she was sad about the robot going



### Student L

- **Note 62** (18.06, note #7 that day): Yes so we're just finishing up for today general notes that it's been lots of really good interactions it's been mostly group interactions with the girls today and some of the regulars that we [are starting to see.] [TIMESTAMP]


- **Note 66** (18.06, note #11 that day): Another interaction where students similar to yesterday had gone out the classroom being quite stressed open physically I guess agitated and preceded to interact with the robot initially selected calm sounds that played the waterfall sandwiches like “no no no not the toilet sound” and preceded to play calm music and listen for a little bit and then return to the classroom. [Student L]


- **Note 69** (18.06, note #14 that day): The last interaction the the kids that and then asked how they were that they were he was excited an that when the robot responded to be that being clicked this with the yellow not great thing things like some confusion as these areas like feeling good rather than kind of not great [Student L] [TIMESTAMP]


- **Note 86** (21.06, note #5 that day): Student L did try to interact with the robot as seen on previous days, but the tablet glitched so had to be reset before he could finish the interaction


- **Note 90** (21.06, note #9 that day): interestingly there was no interaction at all today from some students (Student J2, Student H, Student E2) who had on the first few days spent hours with the robot. Definitely starting to see a shift in regulars (Student L, Student G).


- **Note 106** (22.06, note #14 that day): The interaction that this happened was one of the regulars he's considered a couple of times it's in the situations in and getting there today but that is angry and selected the calm sound but then left


- **Note 123** (23.06, note #5 that day): About that last interaction that was one of our regulars Student L going into the robot and express service did a couple of activities left ultimately before the story could start


- **Note 148** (24.06, note #1 that day): Woman in relation to the last interaction said that the robot is really really helping Student L helping to regulate him, him being Student L


- **Note 171** (24.06, note #1 that day): Student L seen a couple of times initiating interaction


- **Note 187** (29.06, note #2 that day): last interaction that word is one of our regulars Student L briefly interrupted by another student an he clear passed and I clicked on something before low energy something and so both left to report fairly swiftly


- **Note 191** (29.06, note #6 that day): So that last interaction was one of our regulars Student L again Last interaction notes continued I think part of it may have been that he was en route to the bathroom and stopped off at the robot


- **Note 193** (29.06, note #8 that day): OK so it's been pretty busy in the corridor just now the last interaction was Student X again and it started with Student L then transferred to Student X


- **Note 194** (29.06, note #9 that day): okay that last interacting was Student X again and selects the angry but he doesn't seem to show any anger or he says oops and it was an accident and say something to bear in mind while analysing results


- **Note 198** (29.06, note #13 that day): Student L interacting with the robot again and not quite sure what emotion is selected I think it was possibly blue at the start and start the dance got of walked away possibly because another student walked by not quite sure


- **Note 213** (30.06, note #6 that day): Say the last two interactions were Student G and Student L most recently I'm


- **Note 222** (30.06, note #15 that day): Hey that last interaction was Student L and not sure what you mean on the screen is increasingly come maybe a little bit Wednesday for the coming year about climbing sounds and left early no quite sure why


- **Note 246** (01.07, note #9 that day): Hey so that last interaction was Student L notable that he's picked yellow verbally saying that he was excited an Amazon in the Pepper responded with so you are not feeling too good he was like no no delete I'm excited again


- **Note 247** (01.07, note #10 that day): That was Student L her quest to carefully picked out some calming music and as it started playing at him from the left to return to the classroom


- **Note 249** (01.07, note #12 that day): About the last couple of interactions and the last interaction was Student L the one just before that was very


- **Note 264** (02.07, note #7 that day): That last interaction that was Student L again an Nigel said while passing by he had teachers or negotiating with the weather about whether we wanted to spend some time with the robot [or go back to class] an yeah seems to be a fairly calm interaction



### Student J

- **Note 22** (16.06, note #2 that day): Even catch that they have a trouble except in the report yesterday that I needed to be moved there was one demand for it to be moved today but things seem to be pretty chilled this morning


- **Note 31** (16.06, note #11 that day): robot was brought into school later than usual, this upset jack who had thought the robot had been moved elsewhere in the school so pepper's reappearance in this space was upsetting. Discussed with teachers who suggested that it would be best to have the robot in place before the school day started.


- **Note 55** (17.06, note #21 that day): jack requested again that the robot be moved elsewhere, said that he'd been having nightmares about the robot.


- **Note 79** (18.06, note #24 that day): jack again requested that the robot be moved, was the most calm request so far.


- **Note 80** (18.06, note #25 that day): said that father had spoken to Cara (teacher) to ask for the robot to be moved, I said that we would speak to her and ask if there was a better place for the robot. [We spoke to Cara at the end of the day and she said that she had not been contacted by Student J’s father].


- **Note 81** (18.06, note #18 that day): spoke about the robot being similar to another animatronic that he found creepy [did not specify what animatronic when asked], then continued to compare it demons etc.


- **Note 140** (23.06, note #23 that day): Student J has been really struggling with the robot today, the issue seems to at least partly due to needing the bathroom, not wanting to use the ones near to Pepper, and not wanting to use the alternative toilets elsewhere.


- **Note 141** (23.06, note #24 that day): was an altercation around 10.30 where staff had to intervene for my safety


- **Note 142** (23.06, note #25 that day): later I offered to stand in front of the robot so it wouldn't be able to see him (Student J) was told to stop signing because it's annoying and he dived into the nearest bathroom in the area with Pepper.


- **Note 163** (24.06, note #1 that day): Long conversation with Student J he had quite a lot of questions about the robots alright why where was it made why does it follow sounds why is that resonates I last questions about the report and also asking why it was here whether we could move it along with the usual questions to express his displeasure at the robot being here. The upshot hold having some of those questions I think maybe helped a little bit


- **Note 170** (24.06, note #1 that day): Student J still expressing active dislike towards the robot comparing it to a demon and various other things


- **Note 205** (29.06, note #18 that day): Interaction there was some really interesting interactions between students passing by and so there was a point where one student Student J was insulting the robot and Student X he was interacting with a robot so said detect no don't say that about pepper


- **Note 279** (02.07, note #22 that day): interaction around 11.40am was Student X, Student J was present in the corridor, some interaction between the two, with Student X playing/ taunting Student J by dancing along to the robot/ play punching towards Student J.


- **Note 280** (02.07, note #23 that day): Student J took issue with the music being copyrighted (I explained that that music was royalty free)


- **Note 281** (02.07, note #24 that day): a frequent co-occuring complaint from Student J along with the robot are comments about BFDI - after some internet digging this is a show about animated objects (a pin, a ball, ice cube, flower etc etc) that compete. Could there be some connection there?



### Student X

- **Note 121** (23.06, note #3 that day): Note about that last interaction kid said angry both times but then said verbally to me that he's choosing at random [Student X]


- **Note 124** (23.06, note #7 that day): Quickly about the last interaction that was again another random response [Student X]


- **Note 125** (23.06, note #8 that day): Last couple of interactions and that was the same same student I think still answering randomly


- **Note 146** (24.06, note #1 that day): Quickly about the last interaction started by one regular and finished having about other regulars so excited with Student X and then went to Student M he left and the second dance halfway through


- **Note 153** (24.06, note #1 that day): Bye bye interaction Student X one of the robots regulars and which is well past wielding trophy and showed it to Pepper on route


- **Note 166** (24.06, note #1 that day): just before lunch was interaction with Student F and Student X, taking over from one another


- **Note 167** (24.06, note #1 that day): max asked why it had red in its eye


- **Note 175** (25.06, note #4 that day): The last interaction was Student X an what about regulus and the Angus activity editor and say we accidently press that he meant to press arrow


- **Note 176** (25.06, note #5 that day): Kind of Vegas from Student X is sometimes like echoing the robots or the key phrases that ever has he started like preemptively saying them before that the robot says it sometimes with incredible accuracy is too like the tone and pitch of the the way the robot says certain phrases


- **Note 177** (25.06, note #6 that day): Quick note about that last interaction that was Student X again and again accidentally clicked angry rather than the error


- **Note 180** (25.06, note #9 that day): The last interaction was Student X again [TIMESTAMP]


- **Note 190** (29.06, note #5 that day): So about that last interaction that was Student X one of our regulars once again he says that the answering angry on the last thing wasn't accident


- **Note 193** (29.06, note #8 that day): OK so it's been pretty busy in the corridor just now the last interaction was Student X again and it started with Student L then transferred to Student X


- **Note 199** (29.06, note #14 that day): Okay that last interaction was Student X again once again saying accidentally first angry on the end press skip is on route to DT class seem to be using robot possibly as a delaying tactic to go then it's not entirely clear but the member of staff within was self asking indicated the DSO are going to finish the dance with very because it was a short dance


- **Note 200** (29.06, note #15 that day): The last interaction was Student X again once again not clear if the selection of the angry emotions was intentional or not didn't seem to be angry while interacting with the robot an he's still doing the echoing the robot. robots freezes


- **Note 201** (29.06, note #14 that day): OK so that lasted direction was Student X again again clicking angry not sure if that was intentional or not I suspect not continuously again saying about wanting head massage also get very close to of his face an reacting very strongly when this head kind of moves and inverted commas headbutts him knew line and their interaction before that last one was very first time today and doing the dances as usual


- **Note 205** (29.06, note #18 that day): Interaction there was some really interesting interactions between students passing by and so there was a point where one student Student J was insulting the robot and Student X he was interacting with a robot so said detect no don't say that about pepper


- **Note 209** (30.06, note #2 that day): OK so that last interaction was Student X once again said accidentally clicked the angry ever


- **Note 210** (30.06, note #3 that day): Another note out Student X's interactions and pretty much every time he comes out to the road stop he self puts his head enter like the robots hands off asking for his head massage and not entirely clear why he asked for this I have asked him and there's not really been an actual response


- **Note 219** (30.06, note #12 that day): OK so that last interaction was Student X again we had a little bit of a chat while he was interacting with robots and he asked when Pepper was leaving, I said Friday and there was a little bit of a look of a sadness about it. asking did he would you miss pepper and he said yes and asked what you like about paper and he said specifically I like fun dances.


- **Note 220** (30.06, note #13 that day): That last interaction was a bit of a blended one started off with Student X then Student H came out an interesting thing notice with Student X sometimes seems to be actually selecting the angry response intentionally not because he's angry but because he likes what Petter says and following that an evens of echoes and of copies that kind of gestures there pepper does when that option is selected


- **Note 225** (30.06, note #18 that day): OK so that previous that last interaction was Student X again kind of interacting with variable barely standard for Student X interaction yeah lots of insistence on being very close to pepper and to the point of getting headbutted repeatedly and yeah but he sentence is so focused behind head massage then yeah


- **Note 241** (01.07, note #4 that day): Okay so that was that last interaction was Student X wheelchair about the robot what you like to help with really but why he like to visit to which the answer was primarily that because it's a robot an we talked a little bit about the dances and which ones he kinda like the most the saxophone is hello by far the favourite and


- **Note 242** (01.07, note #5 that day): This interaction and it was an Student X again, and again asking for a book the hidden said a little bit about missing the robot after once it's gone.


- **Note 243** (01.07, note #6 that day): Observation from last interaction with maths well as Student X was that there were students passing by in the corridor one who's not really interacted with Pepper very much but she [Student L2] was kind of watching from a distance and Student X tried to engage her to asking her but she's like looking at the robot and then a second student [Charlie?] again one after not really interacted with pepper at all kind of passed by and try to drag Student X away saying that it was dragging him away from the think he said something like a devil possessed robot an impact is still continued to talk to thin air for which the student dragging Student X away kind of justified this is a good reason Student X then returns to the two pepper to finish interaction.


- **Note 253** (01.07, note #16 that day): The last interaction was Student X interacting again seemingly a quick break from class


- **Note 260** (02.07, note #3 that day): And that last interaction was Student X and he selected sad intentionally at the end an other he's got like echoing the behave like the various behaviours in much the same way that he does win it he self selects the angry one he said he specifically chose that one because like he's physically said I chose sad because because you're going [you’re going was directed] towards pepper


- **Note 261** (02.07, note #4 that day): Last interaction was Student X again, and again accidentally selecting the angry rather than the arrow to skip the last question.


- **Note 270** (02.07, note #13 that day): They are those last interactions were Student X and Student F saying goodbye to pepper their attempting to get to the Reebok hugged identify actually need it


- **Note 277** (02.07, note #20 that day): Rolling Pepper out for this afternoon Student X was asking again about it being that this last day with Pepper would and come back go to another school which kind of didn't know yet if you win that would come back to the school go to any other schools


- **Note 279** (02.07, note #22 that day): interaction around 11.40am was Student X, Student J was present in the corridor, some interaction between the two, with Student X playing/ taunting Student J by dancing along to the robot/ play punching towards Student J.



### Student M

- **Note 4** (15.06, note #5 that day): Small interaction just now where to pick up the robot in its entirety from it's not as heavy as I thought it was or the the kids are very strong.


- **Note 47** (17.06, note #16 that day): Yeah the robot just went on a little bit of a trip with the students decided to push it a little bit rather than fully interacting with it [using the screen].


- **Note 48** (17.06, note #17 that day): So we had a brief disconnection with the router courtesy of student going into the office where the router was and turning it off and so the last interaction was interrupted


- **Note 188** (29.06, note #3 that day): OK so notes on the last interaction that was Student G and Student M and who had started interacting with the robot another teen student passed by asked if he was interested


- **Note 189** (29.06, note #4 that day): Last interaction notes continued when one of his peers teenagers another teenage students kind of like pass by asked if he was playing with variable an exceptional AAA cool I say no


- **Note 192** (29.06, note #7 that day): Flyby interaction from Student M touching the screen while walking by although the screen didn't engage he just continued walking



## Non-coded notes 

- **Note 21** (16.06, note #1 that day): General observation today seems to be ever more chill than yesterday


- **Note 93** (22.06, note #2 that day): It's about the last interaction an that word


- **Note 95** (22.06, note #4 that day): Think about the last interaction that one remained unfinished because and the staff came to the student investor undo return arrest her to return to the classroom


- **Note 101** (22.06, note #9 that day): For the last interaction with the robot was with people that have been walking past quite


- **Note 120** (23.06, note #2 that day): About the last interaction that was in Student H one of the regulars from the first couple of days of the experiment who hadn't interacted with it with the robot for a couple of days


- **Note 122** (23.06, note #4 that day): Interaction just now was very little move he had been interacting it with quite a lot yesterday


- **Note 136** (23.06, note #19 that day): A general note for today is that the things have generally been quite quiet today and we've had a few interactions most of them have been with the same two or three students interacting with it a couple of receptions sort of noted in previous notes and yeah otherwise yeah generally kind of quite the immersive interactions were pretty positive with the exception of Student J


- **Note 144** (24.06, note #2 that day): That last interaction that was one Barney regular spray interact with the river sentence is then


- **Note 145** (24.06, note #3 that day): Quick my brain interactions about the music the collected music while it was interacting with videos


- **Note 157** (24.06, note #1 that day): Interaction from just now continued complete without input from teachers had started interaction with the robot including the listening one and he did actually explain to the robot while he was upset which when members of stop overhead come along and said that that was not something that he would like normally do with a [human].


- **Note 182** (25.06, note #11 that day): Okay so it is 2:50 and it's been a very quiet day today I think that has been partially fuelled by there being a school trip which I hadn't realised until just now and some students have come back everyone makes the interactions have been just one or two students and like the same students coming back to the robot and primarily Student X a couple of times, Student L an yeah generally positive interactions minus one incident our kid [Student J2] punching Pepper couple times in the face not hard an with with some frustration but generally positive interactions with pepper today and yeah that's the end of Week 2


- **Note 224** (30.06, note #17 that day): OK so that was next on routine getting lunch row was like a


- **Note 231** (30.06, note #23 that day): General notes of the day it is to about 2:50 at the moment the corridor is pretty empty it's been definitely busier.


- **Note 232** (30.06, note #24 that day): General notes take four an yeah it's been generally fairly quiet but there's definitely been an uptick in activity compared to the past couple of days and I'm wondering if maybe this might be partially fuelled by students or being aware that this is the last week or the last few days for pepper and maybe some of this is possibly reinvigorated their interest in the robot given that some of the questions that we've gotten today I think is pepper going on Friday. Generally very positive interactions with Pepper today so yeah that's the end of Wednesday


- **Note 245** (01.07, note #8 that day): That last interaction was great and next kind of joined in for a little bit and


- **Note 250** (01.07, note #13 that day): And based interactions were one phase injection I think was partially in passing on way to bathroom violence of things have come out specifically for the robot


- **Note 252** (01.07, note #15 that day): And that last interaction was


- **Note 257** (01.07, note #20 that day): Student L came to interact with the robot part way through the photoshoot, more or less ignoring the photographer
